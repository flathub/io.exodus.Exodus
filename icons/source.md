License information for `io.exodus.Exodus.svg`:

- Official SVG Symbol:
  - https://www.exodus.com/brand/dl/images/Exodus_symbol.svg
    (from https://www.exodus.com/brand/)

- Reference app icon from official Linux package, "exodus.png":
  - https://www.exodus.com/download

The official SVG was used as the symbol overlay, while the background was recreated
from scratch in Inkscape based on the reference icon, since the official PNG icon
is very blurry and low-quality (and deviated from the typical Linux border radius).

The symbol is owned by Exodus Movement, Inc.
